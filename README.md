This repo is intended to solve the above challenge. I opted for two solutions: `deps` and `no-deps`. Clearly the goal of the challenge is to see how I appraoach coding a small module. So the challenge is really developed in the `no-deps` solutions. The `deps` one is more of a joke. 

## deps

Uses Yargs and Yargs does it all :smile:

## no-deps

No dependencies used, read the project's README for further information.
